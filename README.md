## Project Title: Lung Cancer Analysis

### Overview:

This project aims to analyze a dataset containing information about individuals, including their smoking habits, alcohol consumption, age, and whether or not they have lung cancer. The dataset provides valuable insights into the relationships between these factors and lung cancer incidence.

### Key Findings:

1. **Smoking and Lung Cancer**: I investigated the connection between smoking habits and lung cancer. The project categorized individuals into different smoking categories, such as 'Non-Smokers,' 'Light Smokers,' 'Mediocre Smokers,' and 'Heavy Smokers.' I found that heavy smokers had a higher incidence of lung cancer.

2. **Alcohol Consumption and Lung Cancer**: I explored how alcohol consumption is related to lung cancer. Similar to smoking, individuals were categorized into different alcohol consumption categories, such as 'Non-Drinkers,' 'Light Drinkers,' 'Mediocre Drinkers,' and 'Heavy Drinkers.' The data indicated that heavy drinkers also had a higher incidence of lung cancer.

3. **Age and Lung Cancer**: I examined the impact of age on lung cancer incidence. By categorizing individuals by age groups, I observed that lung cancer was more prevalent in older age groups.

4. **Percentage of Lung Cancer Among Adults**: I calculated the percentage of individuals with lung cancer among those above the age of 18. This provided an overall view of lung cancer incidence among adults in the dataset.

### Data Visualization:

To visually represent our findings, we used Power BI, a powerful data visualization tool. In Power BI, we created several interactive visualizations:

- **Bar Charts**: Bar charts were employed to illustrate the count of people with lung cancer in each smoking and alcohol consumption category.
- **Percentage Gauge**: A percentage gauge displayed the percentage of lung cancer among adults, providing a quick summary of lung cancer incidence.

### Repository Contents:

- **SQL Queries**: SQL queries used for data analysis.
- **Power BI Report**: The Power BI report (.pbix file) containing interactive visualizations.
